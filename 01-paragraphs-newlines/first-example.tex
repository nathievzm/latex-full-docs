    Example 1: The following paragraph (given in quotes) is an 
    example of centred alignment using the center environment. 

    ``La\TeX{} is a document preparation system and document markup 
    language. \LaTeX{} uses the \TeX{} typesetting program for formatting 
    its output, and is itself written in the \TeX{} macro language. 
    \LaTeX{} is not the name of a particular (executable) typesetting program, but 
    refers to the suite of commands (\TeX{} macros) which form the markup 
    conventions used to typeset \LaTeX{} documents."
