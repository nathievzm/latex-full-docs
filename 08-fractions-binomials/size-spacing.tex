Fractions typeset within a paragraph typically look like this: \(\frac{3x}{2}\).
You can force \LaTeX{} to use the larger display style, such as \( \displaystyle \frac{3x}{2} \),
which also has an effect on line spacing.
The size of maths in a paragraph can also be reduced: \(\scriptstyle \frac{3x}{2}\) or \(\scriptscriptstyle \frac{3x}{2}\).
For the \verb|\scriptscriptstyle| example note the reduction in spacing: characters are moved closer to the \textit{vinculum} (the line separating numerator and denominator).

Equally, you can change the style of mathematics normally typeset in display style:

\[f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\quad \textrm{and}\quad \textstyle f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\quad \textrm{and}\quad \scriptstyle f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\]
